## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent transactions within financial datasets. By identifying key indicators of fraud, the model provides valuable insights and strategies for fraud prevention.

## Project Overview
Fraudulent transactions pose significant challenges in the financial sector. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and predict fraudulent activities. The model is designed to assist businesses in mitigating risks and enhancing their fraud detection capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn` (for model building)
  - `imbalanced-learn` (for handling imbalanced datasets)
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- **Other Libraries**:
  - `NumPy` (for numerical operations)
  - `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn` (for data visualization)

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SriKrishnaMishra/Fraud-detection-model.git
   cd Fraud-detection-model
Install the required packages:
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the model, use the following command:

Copy
python main.py
Make sure to replace main.py with the appropriate script name that contains your model training and evaluation logic.

Data
The dataset used for training the model can be found in the data/ directory. Ensure that the data is preprocessed according to the specifications in the data_preprocessing.py script.

Model Evaluation
The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results can be visualized using the provided plotting functions.
